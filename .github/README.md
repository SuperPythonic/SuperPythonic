Features I want to have in this language:

* Python source code generation, a.k.a. transpilation
* Python syntax compatibility (well, mostly)
* Dependent types
* Type classes a la Haskell 98
* Static reflection, a.k.a. datatype generics
* Builtin effects: Reader, exception, state, IO

More ideas:

* It will be written in Go
* Uses no third-party Go libraries in the project
