Features I want to have in this language:

* Python source code generation, a.k.a. transpilation
* Python syntax compatibility (well, mostly)
* Normalization by Evaluation, dependent types, implicit arguments
* Type classes a la Haskell 98
* Static reflection, a.k.a. datatype generics
* Builtin effects a la Haskell:
    * `hook`: Like `ReaderT`
    * `exn`: Like `ExceptT`
    * `mut`: Like `StateT`
    * `io`: Like `IO`
* Row polymorphic effect types:
    * Concatenation-based
    * Scoped labels
    * Effects as modal in Pi types

More ideas:

* It will be written in Go
* Uses no third-party Go libraries in the project
